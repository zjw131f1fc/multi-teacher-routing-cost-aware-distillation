Thus, points on $\\ell_1$ only satisfy the conditions when $n$ is divisible by $25$ and points on $\\ell_2$ only satisfy the conditions when $n$ is divisible by $13$. Therefore, $a$ is just the number of positive integers less than $2023$ that are divisible by both $25$ and $13$. The LCM of $25$ and $13$ is $325$, so the answer is $\\boxed{6}$.[/hide]",

In a calm winter, there is a possibility of supplying 2200 cubic meters of natural gas and 3500 cubic meters of liquefied gas, while in the event of severe frosts, 3800 cubic meters of natural gas and 2450 cubic meters of liquefied gas. The cost of extraction and transportation of one cubic meter of natural gas is 19 monetary units, and for liquefied gas - 25. The final price for the consumer will be 35 and 58 monetary units, respectively. Determine the optimal strategy for the company to maximize its profit regardless of weather conditions.\n\nNote. The answer is the planned amount of cubic meters of liquefied and natural gas to be extracted and supplied.",

Therefore, to remember his 5-digit bank code, he can remember that none of the digits are zero, the first two digits form a power of 5, the last two digits form a power of 2, the middle digit is a multiple of 3, and the sum of all the digits is an odd number. Now he no longer needs to memorize the number because he knows it is the largest number that satisfies these conditions and has no repeated digits. What is this code?",

At the beginning, only one cell is black and the rest are white. \n\tA turn in this game consists of the following. Marco moves first, and for every move he must choose a cell which is black and which has more than two white neighbors. (Two cells are neighbors if they share an edge, so every cell has exactly four neighbors.) His move consists of making the chosen black cell white and turning all of its neighbors black if they are not already. Vera then performs the following action exactly $k$ times: she chooses two cells that are neighbors to each other and swaps their colors (she is allowed to swap the colors of two white or of two black cells, though doing so has no effect). This, in totality, is a single turn. If Vera leaves the board so that Marco cannot choose a cell that is black and has more than two white neighbors, then Vera wins; otherwise, another turn occurs.\n\tLet $m$ be the minimal $k$ value such that Vera can guarantee that she wins no matter what Marco does.

Maximum 20 points\n\nThe commander of a tank battalion, in celebration of being awarded a new military rank, decided to invite soldiers to a tank festival, where the main delicacy is buckwheat porridge. The commander discovered that if the soldiers are lined up by height, there is a certain pattern in the change of their demand functions. The demand for buckwheat porridge of the shortest soldier is given by $Q d=510-5.1 P$, the next tallest soldier's demand is $Q d=520-5.2 P$, the next one's is $Q d=530-5.3 P$, and so on. The commander's individual demand for buckwheat porridge is $Q d=500-5 P$. The battalion commander always tries to feed as many soldiers as possible. Apart from the commander and the invited soldiers, no one else demands buckwheat porridge. At the festival, 25 perfectly competitive firms offer buckwheat porridge, with each firm's supply function being $Q s=302 P$. The battalion commander, after consulting with his family, decided to make a surprise - initially, the guests and the commander will make decisions about consuming buckwheat porridge, assuming that everyone will pay for it themselves, but at the end of the celebration, the commander's family will pay the total bill from their savings, which amount to 2,525,000 monetary units. If this amount is insufficient, the commander will ask all guests to equally share the remaining bill. It is known that the equilibrium price is set at 20 monetary units. Assume that if guests, like the commander, have to make a certain fixed payment, this payment does not affect their demand for buckwheat porridge.\n\n(a) How is the individual demand of the 60th soldier invited to the celebration described? How will the aggregate demand for buckwheat porridge be described if the commander plans to invite 40 soldiers and does not refuse the porridge himself? Explain the construction of the demand function in this case.\n\n(b) How many soldiers did the commander invite to the celebration? Did the guests have to pay part of the bill? If so, how much did each of them pay?",

Indicate the number of steps sufficient to assert with an error probability not exceeding 0.001 that the reduced speed of the chip is less than 0.01.\n\nLet us recall now that each movement of the chip is conditioned by the result of tossing a coin. If, in $n$ tosses of the coin, heads appear $l$ times and tails appear $n-l$ times, the chip will make $l$ steps to the right and $n-l$ steps to the left and will end up at the point\n\n$$\nl-(n-l)=2 l-n\n$$\n\nThe reduced speed of the chip over $n$ steps will be expressed by the absolute value of the ratio\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 l-n}{n}=2 \\frac{l}{n}-1\n$$\n\nThe fraction $\\frac{l}{n}$ characterizes the frequency of heads appearing.\n\nSuppose a certain allowable error probability is given. As we know, for large values of $n$, it can be asserted with practical certainty that the reduced speed is close to zero. From expression (8), it is clear that if the reduced speed is small, then $2 \\frac{l}{n}$ is approximately equal to 1 and, consequently, the frequency $\\frac{l}{n}$ is close to $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus:\n\nIf a coin is tossed a large number of times, it is practically certain that the frequency of heads appearing will be close to $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nRoughly speaking, it is practically certain that heads will appear in about half of the cases. A more precise formulation states:\n\nChoose an arbitrary allowable error probability $\\varepsilon$ and specify any arbitrarily small number $\\alpha$. If the number of coin tosses exceeds\n\n$$\nN=\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{2} \\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon^{2}}}\n$$\n\nthen with an error probability less than $\\varepsilon$, it can be asserted that the frequency of heads appearing differs from $\\frac{1}{2}$ by less than $\\alpha$.\n\nThe proof of this precise formulation easily follows from statement b) on page 151: if $n>\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{2} \\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon^{2}}}$, then\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}<\\alpha \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{e} \\text { and } \\frac{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt[3]{\\varepsilon}}}{\\sqrt{n}}<2 \\alpha\n$$\n\nThus, with an error probability less than $\\varepsilon$, the reduced speed of the chip is less in absolute value than $2 \\alpha$.\n\nBut the reduced speed in our case is the absolute value of $\\frac{2 l-n}{n}=2 \\frac{l}{n}-1$. Therefore, with an error probability less than $\\varepsilon$, it can be asserted that $2 \\frac{l}{n}$ differs from 1 by less than $2 \\alpha$ or, in other words, $\\frac{l}{n}$ differs from $\\frac{1}{2}$ by less than $\\alpha$.",

    "instruction": "10. $n>10$ teams take part in a soccer tournament. Each team plays every other team exactly once. A win gives two points, a draw one point and a defeat no points. After the tournament, it turns out that each team has won exactly half of its points in the games against the 10 worst teams (in particular, each of these 10 teams has scored half of its points against the 9 remaining teams). Determine all possible values of $n$, and give an example of such a tournament for these values.\n\n## 1st solution\n\nWe call the 10 worst teams the losers, the $n-10$ best teams the winners. We repeatedly use the following fact: If $k$ teams play against each other, then the total number of points won is exactly $k(k-1)$. We count the total number of points won in two ways. On the one hand, this is exactly $n(n-1)$. On the other hand, the 10 losers in the games among themselves receive exactly $10 \\cdot 9=90$ points. By assumption, this is exactly half of the total number of points that these 10 teams have achieved. Consequently, the total number of points scored by the losers is 180. The $n-10$ winners scored a total of $(n-10)(n-11)$ points in the games among themselves. Again, this is half of the total number of points, the latter is therefore equal to $2(n-10)(n-11)$. A comparison yields the equation\n\n$$\nn(n-1)=180+2(n-10)(n-11)\n$$\n\nThis is equivalent to $n^{2}-41 n+400=0$ and has the solutions $n=16$ and $n=25$.\n\nAccording to the above calculations, it also follows that the average score of the $n-10$ winners is equal to 2( $n-11)$, the average score of the 10 losers is equal to 18.\n\nOf course, $2(n-10) \\geq 18$ must now apply, i.e. $n \\geq 20$. Consequently, $n=16$ is not possible.\n\nFinally, we show that such a tournament exists for $n=25$. The 10 losers always play to a draw among themselves, as do the $n-10$ winners among themselves. The following diagram shows the games of the 15 winners $G_{i}$ against the 10 losers $V_{j}$. Where 2 means a win for $G_{i}$, 0$ a win for $V_{j}$ and 1 a draw.\n\n| | $G_{1}$ | $G_{2}$ | $G_{3}$ | $G_{4}$ | $G_{5}$ | $G_{6}$ | $G_{7}$ | $G_{8}$ | $G_{9}$ | $G_{10}$ | $G_{11}$ | $G_{12}$ | $G_{13}$ | $G_{14}$ | $G_{15}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $V_{1}$ | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |\n| $V_{2}$ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |\n| $V_{3}$ | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{4}$ | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{5}$ | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{6}$ | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{7}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 |\n| $V_{8}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 |\n| $V_{9}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |\n| $V_{10}$ | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 |\n\nIn total, the final score of each winner is 28, of which exactly 14 points come from games against the losers. Each loser has a final score of 18, half of which again comes from games against the other losers. This shows everything.\n\n## 2nd solution\n\nHere is another example of such a tournament. Again, the losers and the winners play each other to a draw. Now assume that a winner never loses to a loser. A winner scores a total of 14 points against the other winners, so he must also score 14 points against the losers. To do this, he must win four times and draw six times. Similarly, each loser draws nine times. We can now divide the $10 \\times 15$ table from above into $2 \\times 3$ boxes and obtain the following table with the same notations:\n\n| | $G_{1}, G_{2}, G_{3}$ | $G_{4}, G_{5}, G_{6}$ | $G_{7}, G_{8}, G_{9}$ | $G_{10}, G_{11}, G_{12}$ | $G_{13}, G_{14}, G_{15}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $V_{1}, V_{2}$ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| $V_{3}, V_{4}$ | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| $V_{5}, V_{6}$ | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| $V_{7}, V_{8}$ | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |\n| $V_{9}, V_{10}$ | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 |",

He measured, calculated, and wrote something... and came to an important conclusion. He established that there is a point $O$ equally distant from all sides of the quadrilateral. Then he divided the board into areas by drawing lines from point $O$ to all vertices $A, B, C, D$. He assigned points to the areas inversely proportional to their area. Which area yields the most points and why? Mark's brother added a condition that points are only awarded if the distance from the hit point $T$ to point $O$ is not greater than the distance from point $O$ to any side of the board. Determine the ratio of the area of the part of the board that does not yield points to the area of the part that does yield points.\n\nMark's brother measured these values $|A B|=5 \\mathrm{dm},|B C|=3 \\mathrm{dm},|A D|=4 \\mathrm{dm}$, $|\\angle B A D|=60^{\\circ}$.",

If someone correctly performs addition but cannot multiply or divide by numbers greater than 2, it turns out that they can obtain the product of any two numbers using the following strange method. For example, suppose we need to multiply 97 by 23. We form two columns of numbers:\n\n| 97 | 23 |\n| ---: | :---: |\n| 48 | (46) |\n| 24 | (92) |\n| 12 | (184) |\n| 6 | (368) |\n| 3 | 736 |\n| 1 | 1472 |\n|  | 2231 |\n\nWe successively divide the numbers in the first column by 2, discarding the remainder, until we get 1, and multiply the numbers in the second column by 2 the same number of times. If we cross out the products that stand opposite even numbers in the left column (we have enclosed them in parentheses) and add the remaining ones, we get the correct answer: 2231\n\nWhy?",
